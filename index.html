                    <p>In 2014, my father died in a single-car accident. He veered off the road slowly before crashing into a boulder and succumbing to his injuries. The circumstances were immediately suspicious—this wasn't a typical accident. The slow, gradual drift off the road indicated something had gone wrong before the crash itself, suggesting an underlying medical problem.</p>
                    
                    <p>A toxicology screen was performed, which came back negative. There were no substances impairing his driving. But that only deepened the mystery. What caused him to lose control? The medical examiner performed what they described as an "external autopsy"—essentially a visual examination of the body. No internal investigation. No organ examination. No definitive answers.</p>

                    <p>We were left with nothing but questions. Did he have a heart attack? A stroke? An aneurysm? A seizure? We'll never know. And that uncertainty carries a weight beyond grief—it carries fear. Health problems can be hereditary. Without knowing what took my father from us, we have no way of knowing if his family carries the same risk. Should we be screened for cardiac conditions? Neurological disorders? We're living in the dark.</p>

                    <p>The lack of closure is devastating. The lack of medical information is terrifying. We wanted answers. We deserved answers. But the system that was supposed to provide them decided an external look was sufficient. No formal autopsy was performed. No investigation into why a healthy person suddenly lost control of their vehicle. My mother was not even informed of her right to request an autopsy in the first place.</p>
                    
                    <p>Had she known then what we know now—that she could request a private autopsy, that independent pathologists could provide the answers the state wouldn't—perhaps the circumstances would be different. But she didn't know. She was grieving, confused, and the system offered no guidance, no options, no recourse.</p>

                        <p class="text-navy-900 font-medium">No family should have to live with this uncertainty. No family should have to fear inheriting unknown conditions because the state decided their loved one's death wasn't worth investigating. That is why I am advocating for Pigeaud's Law—so that my father's story, and our family's ongoing fear, might spare others the same fate.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-3">Financial Barriers to Truth</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Private autopsies can cost $3,000–$5,000 or more—an impossible expense for most grieving families. Pigeaud's Law establishes a Private Autopsy Subsidy Fund covering up to 80% of costs (maximum $4,000), ensuring access regardless of income.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-3">No Written Denial Requirement</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Currently, families receive verbal denials or are simply ignored when requesting autopsies. This bill requires written denials within 24 hours, creating accountability and documentation that families can act upon.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-3">Hidden Rights and Resources</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Families don't know private autopsies are an option or that assistance might exist. The bill mandates that all denial notices include information about the right to private autopsy and available financial assistance.</p>

                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Bodies are held indefinitely while paperwork languishes and evidence degrades. This bill requires release of remains within 12 hours of issuing a denial, protecting the integrity of potential evidence.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-3">No Pathologist Directory</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Families scrambling to find qualified forensic pathologists face dead ends and unqualified providers. The bill creates a publicly available list of board-certified forensic pathologists, ensuring families can quickly find legitimate help.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-navy-900 mb-3">Unsustainable Funding Models</h3>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Without dedicated revenue, assistance programs fail. This bill creates sustainable funding through modest fees ($10 per cremation permit, $5 per death certificate copy) that generate approximately $500,000+ annually while maintaining program continuity.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="prose prose-slate text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mx-auto">
                <p class="mb-6">My name is Ronan Pigeaud. I grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts, and I'm currently a student at New York University, studying psychology. My father, François, passed away in 2014, and ever since, I have served as an advocate for childhood grief resources, which I continue as a camp counselor at Experience Camps. I never imagined I would be pushing legislative change to this degree, but grief has transformed my path and inspired a deep sense of purpose.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">After experiencing firsthand the failures of our current system—the inadequate examination, the lack of guidance, the questions about hereditary health risks—I knew I could not simply accept it and move on. Too many other Massachusetts families can and will experience this same negligence without demonstrable change. Too many questions go unanswered, and too many institutions fail those they are meant to serve.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">I named this bill after my family—Pigeaud's Law—because I want it to carry my father's memory forward. I want the name to become synonymous with the right to truth and the protection of families in their most vulnerable moments. What happened to us in 2014 should never happen to another grieving family.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">It is important to note that this is not just about my family—it is about everyone out there who may have experienced, or may experience in the future, the same trauma that has sat in the forefront of my mind for so long. It is about building a system that honors loved ones who have passed by serving those who loved them. It is about removing the connection between hardship and helplessness.</p>

                <p>I am proud to share that I've been in contact with and working alongside the office of Representative Jack Patrick Lewis to get Pigeaud's Law on the legislative docket. This collaboration represents a crucial step forward in transforming this vision into reality for Massachusetts families. However, I could use everyone's help getting this bill on as many desks of representatives as possible—the more voices that speak up, the stronger our chance of making this law a reality.</p>
